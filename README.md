# NextJS Performance Optimization
Next.js is a powerful React framework that delivers exceptional performance out of the box. However, as applications grow, optimizing performance becomes crucial to maintain fast load times, seamless user experiences, and efficient resource utilization. This guide explores practical techniques to enhance Next.js performance, including server-side rendering (SSR) optimizations, static site generation (SSG), code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and caching strategies. Whether you're building a dynamic application or a static website, these examples will help you get the most out of your Next.js project.
